Overview
========
VBinDiff provides a simultaneous hex/ASCII dump of two files, with any
differences between them hilighted in red.  You can scroll both files
simultaneously or each one independently.

Invoking VBinDiff
=================
Just specify the files you want to compare:
  VBinDiff FILE1 FILE2

The only options are to display information about VBinDiff:
  --help          Display this help information and exit
  -L, --license   Display license & warranty information and exit
  -V, --version   Display version information and exit

Using VBinDiff
==============

The Display
-----------
The first line displays the name of the first file, followed by nine
lines (144 bytes) of its contents, 16 bytes per line.  All numbers are
displayed in hexadecimal.  Any differences between the files are
hilighted in red.

Position   Hex data                                          ASCII data
in file
0000 0040: 2D 2D 2D 2D 2D 2D 0D 0A  2F 2F 20 24 49 64 3A 20  ------.. // $Id:
0000 0050: 76 62 69 6E 64 69 66 66  2E 63 63 20 31 2E 35 20  vbindiff .cc 1.5

Note that bytes less than hex 20 are shown as `.' in the ASCII
display.  There is also an extra space between the first 8 and last 8
bytes on the line.

Next comes the name and contents of the second file.

At the bottom is a window displaying the most common commands.

Movement Keys
-------------
Up      Move one line (16 bytes) towards the beginning of the file
Down    Move one line (16 bytes) towards the end of the file
Left    Move one byte towards the beginning of the file
Right   Move one byte towards the end of the file
PageUp  Move one page (8 lines) towards the beginning of the file
PageDn  Move one page (8 lines) towards the end of the file

Holding down Alt while using the movement keys will scroll only the
bottom file.  Holding down Ctrl will scroll only the top file.

Other Keys
----------
Enter  Move to the next difference between the files
Esc    Exit VBinDiff
Q      Exit VBinDiff

Please send me bug reports and suggestions for improvement.  I don't
promise to implement them, but I'll consider it.  If you send a patch,
please send a context diff.  If you want to send money, that's fine
too.
